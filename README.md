The `stringmagic` package introduces a new language tailored to create complex character strings.
Use the function `smagic` to interpolate a variable inside a character string 
and to apply, on-the-fly, any arbitrary string operation. 

It supports over 50 basic operations, seamless customization, nesting, pluralization, and much more.
Writing complex character strings has never been that easy!

To get started with `smagic`, see [the vignette](https://lrberge.github.io/stringmagic/articles/smagic_walkthrough.html).

This package also enhances regular string functions (like `grep` and co) with specialized functions to:

- detect combinations of regular expressions
- chain basic string operations
- clean character string vectors
