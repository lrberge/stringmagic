This vignette describes `stringmagic` tools for handling character vectors. 
It details:

- how to [detect complex regex (=regular expression) patterns](#sec_detect)
- how to easily, and clearly, [chain multiple string operations](#sec_ops)
- how to efficiently, and clearly, [clean character strings](#sec_clean)
- how to quickly [create character vectors](#sec_vec)
- how to [split a vector and turn the result into a data frame, and vice versa](#sec_split)

# Detection of regex patterns {#sec_detect}

Detecting a single regex pattern is pretty straightforward with regular tools
like `base::grepl` or `stringr::string_detect`. Things become more complicated
when we want to detect the presence of multiple patterns. 

`stringmagic` offers three functions with an intuitive syntax to deal with 
complex pattern detection:


# Pattern detection with `string_is`, `string_which` and `string_get` {#detect_funs}

Use `string_is`, `string_which` and `string_get` to detect patterns in character vectors and obtain either 
a logical vector, an integer vector, or the values.

In this section we give examples for `string_get` which hopefully will be explicit 
enough to illustrate how it works. For the record, `string_get` uses `string_is` internally so
these examples are equivalent with `string_is` or `string_which`. 

Ex.1: series of examples using the *recommended syntax*.
```{r}
cars = row.names(mtcars)
cat_magic("All cars from mtcars:\n{C, 60 width ? cars}")

# cars with an 'a', an 'e', an 'i', and an 'o', all in lower case
string_get(cars, "a & e & i & o")

# cars with no 'e' and at least one digit
string_get(cars, "!e & \\d")

# flags apply to all
# contains the 'words' 2, 9 or l
# alternative syntax for flags: "wi/2 | 9 | l"
string_get(cars, "word, ignore/2 | 9 | l")
```

The default syntax is `string_get(x, ...)` (same for `string_is` and `string_which`), 
where `...` contains any number of patterns
to detect. By default the results of these pattern detections are combined with 
a logical AND. To combine them with a logical OR, you need to use the argument
`or = TRUE`. You can also pass the flags as regular function arguments. They then
apply to all patterns.

Ex.2: replication of Ex.1 using an alternative syntax.
```{r}
# string_get(cars, "a & e & i & o")
# cars with an 'a', an 'e', an 'i', and an 'o', all in lower case
string_get(cars, "a", "e", "i", "o")

# string_get(cars, "!e & \\d")
# cars with no 'e' and at least one digit
string_get(cars, "!e", "\\d")

# string_get(cars, "!/e & \\d")
# This example cannot be replicated directly, we need to apply logical equivalence
string_get(cars, "!e", "!\\d", or = TRUE)

# string_get(cars, "wi/2 | 9 | l")
# contains the 'words' 2, 9 or l
string_get(cars, "2", "9", "l", or = TRUE, word = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

### Specificities of `srt_get` {#detect_get}

On top of the detection previously described, the function `srt_get` changes its 
behavior with the arguments `seq` or `seq.unik`. It also supports [automatic caching](#get_caching).

#### Sequentially appending results

As seen previously, patterns in `...` are combined with a logical AND. If you set
`seq = TRUE`, this behavior changes. The results of each pattern becomes stacked 
sequentially. Schematically, you obtain the vector `c(x_that_contains_pat1, x_that_contains_pat2, etc)`
with `pat1` the first pattern in `...`, `pat2` the second pattern, etc.

Using `seq.unik = TRUE` is like `seq` but applies the function `unique()` at the end.

Ex: sequentially combining results.
```{r}
# cars without digits, then cars with 2 'a's or 2 'e's and a digit
string_get(cars, "!\\d", "i/a.+a | e.+e & \\d", seq = TRUE)

# let's get the first word of each car name
car_first = string_ops(cars, "extract.first")
# we select car brands ending with 'a', then ending with 'i'
string_get(car_first, "a$", "i$", seq = TRUE)
# seq.unik is similar to seq but applies unique()
string_get(car_first, "a$", "i$", seq.unik = TRUE)
```

#### Caching {#get_caching}

At the exploration stage, we often run the same command with a few
variations on the same data set. Acknowledging this, `string_get` supports the caching
of the data argument in interactive use. This means that the user can concentrate in
the pattern to find and need not bother to write the data from where to fectch the
values. Note that `string_get` is the only `stringmagic` function to have this
ability.

Caching is always enabled, you don't need to do anything.

Ex: caching of the data.
```{r}
# Since we used `car_first` in the previous example, we don't need to provide
# it explicitly now
# => brands containing 'M' and ending with 'a' or 'i'; brands containing 'M'
string_get("M & [ai]$", "M", seq.unik = TRUE)
```

# Chaining string operations with `string_ops` {#sec_ops}

Formatting text data often requires applying many functions
(be it for parsing, text analysis, etc). 
Even for simple tasks, the number of operations can quickly balloon, adding many
lines of code, reducing readability, and all this for basic processing.

The function `string_ops` tries to solve this problem. 
It has access to all (50+) [`string_magic` operations](https://lrberge.github.io/stringmagic/articles/ref_operations.html), allowing for
a compact and readable way to chain basic operations on character strings.

Below are a few motivating examples.

Ex.1: Parsing data.
```{r}
# parsing an input: extracting the numbers
input = "8.5in, 5.5, .5 cm"
string_ops(input, "','split, tws, '^\\. => 0.'replace, '^\\D+|\\D+$'replace, num")


# Explanation------------------------------------------------------------------|
# ','split: splitting w.r.t. ','                                               |
# tws: trimming the whitespaces                                                |
# '^\\. => 0.'replace: adds a 0 to strings starting with '.'                   |
# '^\\D+|\\D+$'replace: removes non-digits on both ends of the string          |
# num: converts to numeric                                                     |


# now extracting the units
string_ops(input, "','split, '^[ \\d.]+'replace, tws")


# Explanation------------------------------------------------------------------|
# ','split: splitting w.r.t. ','                                               |
# '^[ \\d.]+'replace: removes the ' ', digit                                   |
#                     and '.' at the beginning of the string                   |
# tws: trimming the whitespaces                                                |
```

Ex.2: extracing information from text.
```{r}
# Now using the car data
cars = row.names(mtcars)

# let's get the brands starting with an "m"
string_ops(cars, "'i/^m'get, x, unik")


# Explanation------------------------------------------------------------------|
# 'i/^m'get: keeps only the elements starting with an m,                       |
#            i/ is the 'regex-flag' "ignore" to ignore the case                |
#            ^m means "starts with an m" in regex language                     |
# x: extracts the first pattern. The default pattern is "[[:alnum:]]+"         |
#    which means an alpha-numeric word                                         |
# unik: applies unique() to the vector                                         |


# let's get the 3 largest numbers appearing in the car models
string_ops(cars, "'\\d+'x, rm, unik, num, dsort, 3 first")


# Explanation------------------------------------------------------------------|
# '\\d+'x: extracts the first pattern, the pattern meaning "a succession"      |
#          of digits in regex language                                         |
# rm: removes elements equal to the empty string (default behavior)            |
# unik: applies unique() to the vector                                         |
# num: converts to numeric                                                     |
# dsort: sorts in decreasing order                                             |
# 3 first: keeps only the first three element                                  |
```

As you can see, an operation that would take multiple lines to read and understand
now can be read from left to right in a single line.

# `string_clean`: One function to clean them all {#sec_clean}

The function `string_clean` streamlines the cleaning of character vectors by providing:

- i) a specialized syntax to replace multiple regex patterns, 
- ii) a direct access to many low level string operations, and 
- iii) the ability to chain these two operations. 

## Cleaning syntax

This function is of the form `string_clean(x, ...)` with `x` the vector to clean and
`...` any number of cleaning operations which can be of two types:

1. use `"pat1, pat2 => replacement"` to replace the regex patterns `pat1` and `pat2` 
with the value `replacement`.
1. use `"@op1, op2"` to perform any arbitrary sequence of [`string_magic` operation](https://lrberge.github.io/stringmagic/articles/ref_operations.html)

In the operation `"pat1, pat2 => replacement"`, the pattern is first split with respect
to the pipe, `" => "` (change it with argument `pipe`), to get `replacement`. 
Then the pattern is split with respect to commas (i.e. `",[ \t\n]+"`, change it with argument `sep`) 
to get `pat1` and `pat2`. A sequence of `base::gsub` calls is performed to replace each
`patx` with `replacement`. 

By default the replacement is the empty string. This means that writting `"pat1, pat2"`
will lead to erasing these two patterns.

If a pattern starts with an `"@"`, the subsequent character string is sent to `string_ops`.
For example `"@ascii, lower"` is equivalent to `string_ops(x, "ascii, lower")` which 
turns `x` to ASCII and lowers the case. 

## Example of text cleaning {#clean_example}

```{r}
monologue = c("For who would bear the whips and scorns of time",
              "Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,",
              "The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,",
              "The insolence of office, and the spurns",
              "That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,",
              "When he himself might his quietus make",
              "With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,",
              "To grunt and sweat under a weary life,",
              "But that the dread of something after death-",
              "The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn",
              "No traveller returns- puzzles the will,",
              "And makes us rather bear those ills we have",
              "Than fly to others that we know not of?")

# Cleaning a text
string_clean(monologue, 
          # use string_magic to: lower the case and remove basic stopwords
          "@lower, stopword",
          # remove a few extra stopwords(we use the flag word 'w/')
          "w/th, 's",
          # manually stem some verbs
          "despis'd => despise", "undiscover'd => undiscover", "(m|t)akes => \\1ake",
          # still stemming: dropping the ending 's' for words of 4+ letters, except for quietus
          "(\\w{3,}[^u])s\\b => \\1",
          # normalizing the whitespaces + removing punctuation
          "@ws.punct")

```


# Create simple character vectors with `string_vec` {#sec_vec}


The function `string_vec` is dedicated to the creation of small character vectors.
You feed it a comma separated list of values in a string and it will turn it 
into a vector. 

Ex.1: creating a simple vector.
```{r}
fruits = string_vec("orange, apple, pineapple, strawberry")
fruits
```

Within the enumeration, you can use interpolation, with curly brackets (`{}`), to 
insert the elements from a vector into the current string. 

Ex.2: adding a vector into an enumeration.
```{r}
more_fruits = string_vec("lemon, {fruits}, peach")
more_fruits
```

The interpolation is performed with [`string_magic`](https://lrberge.github.io/stringmagic/articles/guide_string_magic.html). This means that any [`string_magic` operation](https://lrberge.github.io/stringmagic/articles/ref_operations.html)
can be applied on-the-fly.

Ex.3: replicating Ex.2 but shortening long fruit names.
```{r}
more_fruits = string_vec("lemon, {6 Shorten ? fruits}, peach")
more_fruits
```

Since interpolations are resolved with `string_magic`, you can add any text before/after the 
interpolation:

Ex.4: adding text before the interpolation.
```{r}
pkgs = string_vec("pandas, os, time, re")
imports = string_vec("import numpy as np, import {pkgs}")
imports
```

### Creating small matrices or data frames

You can transform the returned vector into a matrix or a data frame using the 
arguments `.cmat`, `.nmat` (**c**haracter or **n**umeric matrix) or `.df`.

Ex.5: returning a matrix.
```{r}
string_vec("1, 5,
            3, 2,
            5, 12", .nmat = TRUE)
```

The number of rows is guessed from the number of newlines in the string. You can avoid using
character strings, but in that case you need to explicitly give the number of rows.

Ex.5-bis: returning a numeric matrix, giving `.nmat` the number of rows.
```{r}
string_vec(1, 5,
           3, 2,
           5, 12, .nmat = 3)
```

If you want to return a data.frame, you can add the column names in the .df argument: either
in a regular vector, either in a comma separated list. Note that columns looking like
numeric values are always converted.

Ex.6: returning a data frame.
```{r}
# you can add the column names directly in the argument .df
df = string_vec("1, john,
                 3, marie,
                 5, harry", .df = "id, name")
df

# automatic conversion of numeric values
df$id * 5
```

# Split vectors and turn the result into a data frame, and vice versa {#sec_split}

The function `string_split2df` (and `string_split2dt`) splits a vector using a 
regular expression pattern and turns it into a data frame, remembering the 
original identifiers. You can get the original vectors back (almost) with the 
function `paste_conditional`.

Ex.1: breaking up two sentences with respect to punctuation and spaces; then merging them back.
```{r}
x = c("Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.",
      "When my information changes, I alter my conclusions.")

# we split at each word
sentences_split = string_split2df(x, "[[:punct:] ]+")
sentences_split

# recovering the original vectors (we only lose the punctuation)
paste_conditional(sentences_split$x, sentences_split$obs)
```

If identifiers are associated to the elements of the vector, you can provide them
so that the data frame returned contains them.

Ex.2: splitting with identifiers and merging back with a formula.
```{r}
id = c("ws", "jmk")
# we add the identifier
base_words = string_split2df(x, "[[:punct:] ]+", id = list(author = id))

# merging back using a formula
paste_conditional(x ~ author, base_words)
```
