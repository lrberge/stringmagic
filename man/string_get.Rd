\usage{
string_get(
  x,
  ...,
  fixed = FALSE,

  word = FALSE,
  or = FALSE,
  seq = FALSE,
  seq.unik = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector.}

\item{...}{Character scalars representing the patterns to be found. By default they are (perl) regular-expressions.
Use ' & ' or ' | ' to chain patterns and combine their result logically (ex: \code{'[[:alpha:]] & \\\\d'} gets strings
containing both letters and numbers). You can negate by adding a \code{!} first (ex: \code{"!sepal$"} will
return \code{TRUE} for strings that do not end with \code{"sepal"}).
Add flags with the syntax 'flag1, flag2/pattern'. Available flags are: 'fixed', 'ignore', 'word' and 'magic'.
Ex: "ignore/sepal" would get "Sepal.Length" (wouldn't be the case w/t 'ignore').
Shortcut: use the first letters of the flags. Ex: "if/dt[" would get \code{"DT[i = 5]"} (flags 'ignore' + 'fixed').
For 'word', it adds word boundaries to the pattern. The \code{magic} flag first interpolates
values directly into the pattern with "{}".}

\item{fixed}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. Whether to trigger a fixed search instead of a
regular expression search (default).}

\item{ignore.case}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, then case insensitive search is triggered.}

\item{word}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} then a) word boundaries are added to the pattern,
and b) patterns can be chained by separating them with a comma, they are combined with an OR logical operation.
Example: if \code{word = TRUE}, then pattern = "The, mountain" will select strings containing either the word
'The' or the word 'mountain'.}

\item{or}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. In the presence of two or more patterns,
whether to combine them with a logical "or" (the default is to combine them with a logical "and").}

\item{seq}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. The argument \code{pattern} accepts a vector of
patterns which are combined with an \code{and} by default. If \code{seq = TRUE}, then it is like
if \code{string_get} was called sequentially with its results stacked. See examples.}

\item{seq.unik}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. The argument \code{...} (or the argument \code{pattern}) accepts
a vector of patterns which are combined with an \code{and} by default. If \code{seq.unik = TRUE}, then
\code{string_get} is called sequentially with its results stacked, and \code{unique()} is
applied in the end. See examples.}

\item{pattern}{(If provided, elements of \code{...} are ignored.) A character vector representing the
patterns to be found. By default a (perl) regular-expression search is triggered.
Use ' & ' or ' | ' to chain patterns and combine their result logically (ex: \code{'[[:alpha:]] & \\\\d'} gets strings
containing both letters and numbers). You can negate by adding a \code{!} first (ex: \code{"!sepal$"} will
return \code{TRUE} for strings that do not end with \code{"sepal"}).
Add flags with the syntax 'flag1, flag2/pattern'. Available flags are: 'fixed', 'ignore', 'word' and 'magic'.
Ex: "ignore/sepal" would get "Sepal.Length" (wouldn't be the case w/t 'ignore').
Shortcut: use the first letters of the flags. Ex: "if/dt[" would get \code{"DT[i = 5]"} (flags 'ignore' + 'fixed').
For 'word', it adds word boundaries to the pattern. The \code{magic} flag first interpolates
values directly into the pattern with "{}".}

\item{envir}{Environment in which to evaluate the interpolations if the flag \code{"magic"} is provided.
Default is \code{parent.frame()}.}

\section{Caching}{


In an exploratory stage, it can be useful to quicky get values from a vector with the
least hassle as possible. Hence \code{string_get} implements caching, so that users do not need
to repeat the value of the argument \code{x} in successive function calls, and can concentrate
only on the selection patterns.

Caching is a feature only available when the user calls \code{string_get} from the global environment.
If that feature were available in regular code, it would be too dangerous, likely leading to hard to debug bugs.
Hence caching is disabled when used within code (i.e. inside a function or inside an
automated script), and function calls without the main argument will lead to errors in such scripts.
}

\section{Generic regular expression flags}{


All \code{stringmagic} functions support generic flags in regular-expression patterns.
The flags are useful to quickly give extra instructions, similarly to \emph{usual}
\href{https://javascript.info/regexp-introduction}{regular expression flags}.

Here the syntax is "flag1, flag2/pattern". That is: flags are a comma separated list of flag-names
separated from the pattern with a slash (\code{/}). Example: \code{string_which(c("hello...", "world"), "fixed/.")} returns \code{1}.
Here the flag "fixed" removes the regular expression meaning of "." which would have otherwise meant \emph{"any character"}.
The no-flag verion \code{string_which(c("hello...", "world"), ".")} returns \code{1:2}.

Alternatively, and this is recommended, you can collate the initials of the flags instead of using a
comma separated list. For example: "if/dt[" will apply the flags "ignore" and "fixed" to the pattern "dt[".

The four flags always available are: "ignore", "fixed", "word" and "magic".
\itemize{
\item "ignore" instructs to ignore the case. Technically, it adds the perl-flag "(?i)"
at the beginning of the pattern.
\item "fixed" removes the regular expression interpretation, so that the characters ".", "$", "^", "["
(among others) lose their special meaning and are treated for what they are: simple characters.
\item "word" adds word boundaries (\code{"\\\\b"} in regex language) to the pattern. Further, the comma (\code{","})
becomes a word separator. Technically, "word/one, two" is treated as "\\b(one|two)\\b". Example:
\code{string_clean("Am I ambushed?", "wi/am")} leads to " I ambushed?" thanks to the flags "ignore" and "word".
\item "magic" allows to interpolate variables inside the pattern before regex interpretation.
For example if \code{letters = "aiou"} then \code{string_clean("My great goose!", "magic/[{letters}] => e")}
leads to \code{"My greet geese!"}
}
}

\examples{

x = rownames(mtcars)

# find all Mazda cars
string_get(x, "Mazda")
# same with ignore case flag
string_get(x, "i/mazda")

# all cars containing a single digit (we use the 'word' flag)
string_get(x, "w/\\\\d")

# finds car names without numbers AND containing `u`
string_get(x, "!\\\\d", "u")
# equivalently
string_get(x, "!\\\\d & u")

# Stacks all Mazda and Volvo cars. Mazda first
string_get(x, "Mazda", "Volvo", seq = TRUE)

# Stacks all Mazda and Volvo cars. Volvo first
string_get(x, "Volvo", "Mazda", seq = TRUE)

# let's get the first word of each car name
car_first = string_ops(x, "extract.first")
# we select car brands ending with 'a', then ending with 'i'
string_get(car_first, "a$", "i$", seq = TRUE)
# seq.unik is similar to seq but applies unique()
string_get(car_first, "a$", "i$", seq.unik = TRUE)

#
# flags
#

# you can combine the flags
x = smagic("/One, two, one... Two!, Microphone, check")
# regular
string_get(x, "one")
# ignore case
string_get(x, "i/one")
# + word boundaries
string_get(x, "iw/one")

# you can escape the meaning of ! with backslashes
string_get(x, "\\\\!")

#
# Caching
#

# Caching is enabled when the function is used interactively
# so you don't need to repeat the argument 'x'
# Mostly useful at an exploratory stage

if(interactive() && is.null(sys.calls())){
   
   # first run, the data is cached
   string_get(row.names(mtcars), "i/vol")

   # now you don't need to specify the data
   string_get("i/^m & 4")
