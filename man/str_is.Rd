\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector.}

\item{...}{Character scalars representing the patterns to be found. By default they are (perl) regular-expressions.
Use ' & ' or ' | ' to chain patterns and combine their result logically (ex: \code{'[[:alpha:]] & \\\\d'} gets strings
containing both letters and numbers). You can negate by adding a \code{!} first (ex: \code{"!sepal$"} will
return \code{TRUE} for strings that do not end with \code{"sepal"}).
Add flags with the syntax 'flag1, flag2/pattern'. Available flags are: 'fixed', 'ignore', 'word', 'verbatim'.
Ex: "ignore/sepal" would get "Sepal.Length" (wouldn't be the case w/t 'ignore').
Shortcut: use the first letters of the flags. Ex: "if/dt[" would get \code{"DT[i = 5]"} (flags 'ignore' + 'fixed').
The flag 'verbatim' does not parse logical operations. For 'word', it adds word boundaries to the
pattern. See the documentation of this argument.}

\item{fixed}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. Whether to trigger a fixed search instead of a
regular expression search (default).}

\item{ignore.case}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, then case insensitive search is triggered.}

\item{word}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} then a) word boundaries are added to the pattern,
and b) patterns can be chained by separating them with a comma, they are combined with an OR logical operation.
Example: if \code{word = TRUE}, then pattern = "The, mountain" will select strings containing either the word
'The' or the word 'mountain'.}

\item{or}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. In the presence of two or more patterns,
whether to combine them with a logical "or" (the default is to combine them with a logical "and").}

\item{pattern}{(If provided, elements of \code{...} are ignored.) A character vector representing the
patterns to be found. By default a (perl) regular-expression search is triggered.
Use ' & ' or ' | ' to chain patterns and combine their result logically (ex: \code{'[[:alpha:]] & \\\\d'} gets strings
containing both letters and numbers). You can negate by adding a \code{!} first (ex: \code{"!sepal$"} will
return \code{TRUE} for strings that do not end with \code{"sepal"}).
Add flags with the syntax 'flag1, flag2/pattern'. Available flags are: 'fixed', 'ignore', 'word', 'verbatim'.
Ex: "ignore/sepal" would get "Sepal.Length" (wouldn't be the case w/t 'ignore').

The flag 'verbatim' does not parse logical operations. For 'word', it adds word boundaries to the
pattern. See the documentation of this argument.}
}
\value{
It returns a logical vector of the same length as \code{x}.

The function \code{str_which} returns a numeric vector.
}
\description{
Function that detects if one or more patterns are in a string. The patterns can be
chained, by default this is a regex search but special flags be triggered with a
specific syntax, supports negation.
}
\details{
The internal function used to find the patterns is \code{\link[base:grep]{base::grepl()}} with \code{perl = TRUE}.

\section{Generic regular expression flags}{


All \code{stringmagic} functions support generic flags in regular-expression patterns.
The flags are useful to quickly give extra instructions, similarly to \emph{usual}
\href{https://javascript.info/regexp-introduction}{regular expression flags}.

Here the syntax is "flag1, flag2/pattern". That is: flags are a comma separated list of flag-names
separated from the pattern with a slash (\code{/}). Example: \code{str_which(c("hello...", "world"), "fixed/.")} returns \code{1}.
Here the flag "fixed" removes the regular expression meaning of "." which would have otherwise meant \emph{"any character"}.
The no-flag verion \code{str_which(c("hello...", "world"), ".")} returns \code{1:2}.

Alternatively, and this is recommended, you can collate the initials of the flags instead of using a
comma separated list. For example: "if/dt[" will apply the flags "ignore" and "fixed" to the pattern "dt[".

The four flags always available are: "ignore", "fixed", "word" and "magic".
\itemize{
\item "ignore" instructs to ignore the case. Technically, it adds the perl-flag "(?i)"
at the beginning of the pattern.
\item "fixed" removes the regular expression interpretation, so that the characters ".", "$", "^", "["
(among others) lose their special meaning and are treated for what they are: simple characters.
\item "word" adds word boundaries (\code{"\\\\b"} in regex language) to the pattern. Further, the comma (\code{","})
becomes a word separator. Technically, "word/one, two" is treated as "\\b(one|two)\\b". Example:
\code{str_clean("Am I ambushed?", "wi/am")} leads to " I ambushed?" thanks to the flags "ignore" and "word".
\item "magic" allows to interpolate variables inside the pattern before regex interpretation.
For example if \code{letters = "aiou"} then \code{str_clean("My great goose!", "magic/[{letters}] => e")}
leads to \code{"My greet geese!"}
}
}

\examples{

# NOTA: using `str_get` instead of `str_is` may lead to a faster understanding 
#       of the examples 

x = smagic("/one, two, one... two, microphone, check")

# default is regular expression search
# => 3 character items
str_is(x, "^...$")

# to trigger fixed search use the flag 'fixed'
str_is(x, "fixed/...")
# you can just use the first letter
str_is(x, "f/...")

# to negate, use '!'
str_is(x, "!f/...")
# or directly in the pattern
str_is(x, "f/!...")

# you can combine several patterns with "&" or "|"
str_is(x, "one & c")
str_is(x, "one | c")

#
# word: adds word boundaries
#

# compare
str_is(x, "one")
# with
str_is(x, "w/one")

# words can be chained with commas (it is like an OR logical operation)
str_is(x, "w/one, two")
# compare with
str_is(x, "w/one & two")
# remember that you can still negate
str_is(x, "w/one & !two")#' 

# you can combine the flags
# compare
str_is(x, "w/ONE")
# with
str_is(x, "wi/ONE")

#
# str_which
#

# it works exactly the same way as str_is
# Which are the items containing an 'e' and an 'o'?
str_which(x, "e", "o")
# equivalently
str_which(x, "e & o")
