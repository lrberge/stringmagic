# stringmagic 1.0.0

First public release. The syntax should be stable.  

This package is a spinoff from [fixest's formula syntax interpolation](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/xpd.html).

Many thanks to Achim Zeileis, Vincent Arel-Bundock and Kyle Butts who provided insightful comments
during the development.
